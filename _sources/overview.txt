Overview
========
If you are used to any other evolutionary algorithm framework, you'll notice
we do things differently with DEAP. Instead of limiting you with predefined
types, we provide ways of creating the appropriate ones. Instead of providing
closed initializers, we enable you to customize them as you wish. Instead of
suggesting unfit operators, we explicitly ask you to choose them wisely.
Instead of implementing many sealed algorithms, we allow you to write the ones
that fit all your needs. This tutorial will present a quick overview of what
DEAP is all about along with what every DEAP program is made of.
